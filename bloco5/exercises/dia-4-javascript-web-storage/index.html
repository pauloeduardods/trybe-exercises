      <h3>Como o bitcoin funciona</h3>
      <p>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
        trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
        most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
      </p>
      <h3>Timestamp Server</h3>
      <p>The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a
        hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a
        newspaper or Usenet post [2-5].
      </p>
      <h3>Proof-of-Work</h3>
      <p>To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proofof-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
        The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
        hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number
        of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash
